# Welcome

SupportKit adds beautifully simple messaging to your app to keep your users engaged and coming back. If you want to learn more about SupportKit, then visit our website at [http://supportkit.io](http://supportkit.io) or [sign up here](https://app.supportkit.io). This page provides in-depth documentation on SupportKit's features and is meant to be a guide for developers integrating the SDK and app makers seeking to engage with their users.

Source code examples are provided for all of our SDKs, including both Objective-C and Swift for iOS. You can view code examples inline, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top left.

For more in-depth details on SupportKit's API check out our [API reference](<%= "#{api_docs_link}" %>). The API reference documents every method and property available through SupportKit. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to us [here](mailto:help@supportkit.io).
