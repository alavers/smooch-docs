## Shopify

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is a simple way to set up an online store to organize products, accept credit card payments, and manage orders.

This integration adds the Smooch web plugin to your Shopify online store. Smooch will set your `appToken` and add the code snippet in your theme.

### Adding Smooch to your store

In order to append the plugin to your theme, all you need to do is to press on _Authenticate_ from the integration page or install Smooch from the [Shopify marketplace](https://apps.shopify.com/smooch).
