## Twilio

[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) allows you to get a phone number to send and receive SMS via their API. Our Twilio integration allows your users to send you text messages at your Twilio number for your to receice in any of our channel like Slack, Hipchat or HelpScout. Your replies are sent back as SMS to their phone.

### Configuring Twilio

You'll need a Twilio account with a phone number configured on it. A trial account is ok to test but is only good to send SMS to the phone you used while signing up. Once equiped with your account, you need to copy your API credentials over Smooch.
