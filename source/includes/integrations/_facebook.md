## Facebook

Our Facebook integration allows your users to send you Facebook messages through your Facebook Page which you receive in any of our channels like Slack, HipChat or Help Scout. Your replies are sent back as a Facebook message to the user.

Since this integration relies on Facebook webhooks, which introduces delay, it takes a few seconds or more to receive new messages from Facebook users.

### Configuring Facebook

To use the Facebook integration, you need a Facebook account with permissions to manage a Facebook page. You then need to visit the Facebook integration page and press on "Connect your Facebook account". This will redirect you to Facebook where you will need to allow Smooch to access your account information.

Once your Facebook account is connected to Smooch, select the Facebook page you want to use and hit save. You should now be able to receive messages from your Facebook page and reply via any of your configured channels.
