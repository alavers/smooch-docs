## Hipchat

Hipchat is a team-based chat tool that helps to group all of your team's conversations and workflow into one beautiful, searchable place.

Smooch has a Hipchat integration that allows your team to communicate with your app's users, without leaving Hipchat.

### Configuring Hipchat

#### Step 1. Authorize Smooch so that it can talk to your Hipchat

Hipchat Connect has allowed Smooch to integrate into Hipchat in some awesome ways.

You can easily view your active conversations and user profiles at a glance.

We've also added some handy options to the context menu so that you can easily use Smooch's features directly within Hipchat.

This makes adding internal notes for fellow colleagues really easy.

And you can send your users action buttons through an interface we baked specially for Hipchat.
