## Stripe

Stripe is a developer-friendly platform that instantly enables businesses to accept and manage payments online and in mobile apps. Our Stripe integration allows you to ask money to your users and accept payments directly within the conversation. Credit card informations is never seen by our servers, everything related to transactions is all handled by Stripe.

### Configuring Stripe

From the Stripe integration page, select which Stripe mode you want Smooch to be using. 

![Stripe integration page ui](Stripe_integration_page_ui.png)

Use Test mode during development, so you can use test [credit card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards). Select Live to get real money ðŸ¤‘.

Then Click "Authenticate your Stripe account". This will send you to a Stripe page where you can select which Stripe account to link Smooch with.

If you are using test mode, notice the "Skip this account form" at the top of the Stripe page. No need for a bank account for test mode.

### Requesting payments

While inside a conversation with a user you can send a buy button with the following syntax

```
$[Button label here](25.00)
```

This works from any channel you configured to use with Smooch.

The amount you specify can be just a dollars amount or dollars and cents as in the example.

Once the user completes a payment you'll get a confirmation along with a link to the payment page on Stripe.

If your users are messaging you by SMS via our [Twillo](#twilio) integration, they'll be getting a web link instead of a buy button. It will take them to a payment web page where we use [Checkout.js](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout) from Stripe to secure the payment. This mechanism is also used for versions prior to 3.3 of the SDK.
