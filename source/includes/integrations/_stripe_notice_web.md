If your users are messaging you by SMS via our [Twilio](#twilio) integration, they'll be getting a web link instead of a buy button. It will take them to a payment web page where we use [Checkout.js](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout) from Stripe to secure the payment. This mechanism is also used for Smooch Web SDK versions older than 2.1.
