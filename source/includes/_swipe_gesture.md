# Swipe gesture for help

Great support should be accessible to your users no matter where they are in your app, which is why weâ€™ve designed a unique, yet simple gesture that allows users to get help in your app. Simply swipe down on the screen with two fingers, and your users will be gently led into Smooch.

When enabled, the first time that your user enters Smooch through a button tap or some other means, Smooch will display a quick tip informing the user that support is always a two-finger swipe away. This helps users get access to help from anywhere in your app and helps them follow instructions you may provide them through help content or in a conversation.

This functionality is enabled by default. To learn more about how to control it, please visit our [API reference](http://docs.smooch.io/api)
