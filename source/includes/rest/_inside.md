# Introduction

The Messaging Inside API allows software vendors to provision and configure their own Smooch apps to make use of Smooch's front-end messaging channels and the Core REST API.

Apps that are provisioned in this way will be API only, the management dashboard wonâ€™t be available.

# Authentication

Software vendors will be issued an app maker scoped JSON Web Token that can be used to create and manage Smooch apps. For more information on how Smooch uses JWTs, [see here](#authentication).

## Acquiring your App Maker Scoped Token

To acquire the app maker scoped token, create a Smooch account and walk through the initial setup process. At the end of that process you'll be able to contact us by chat and talk to us about getting your token.

## Using the App Maker Scoped Token

Use the app maker scoped Token in the same way that you would use an app or appUser scoped JSON Web Token, by passing it as an Authorization header, with the token prefaced by the _Bearer_ keyword.

```
curl https://api.smooch.io/v1/apps \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -H 'authorization: Bearer your-appmaker-token'
```


# Apps

Endpoints used for provisioning Smooch apps.

## Create App

```

<api>`GET /v1/apps/{appId}`</api>

## App Management API

All of the existing app management APIs such as /v1/appusers and /v1/webhooks will be accessible using an appMaker JWT, provided the app id is included in the front of the path.

For example, to create a webhook for an app

```
curl https://api.smooch.io/v1/apps/55c8d9758590aa1900b9b9f6/webhooks \
    -d '{"target": "http://example.com/callback"}' \
    -H 'authorization: Bearer your-appmaker-token'
```

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Or to fetch a conversation

```
curl https://api.smooch.io/v1/apps/55c8d9758590aa1900b9b9f6/appusers/c7f6e6d6c3a637261bd9656f/conversation \
    -H 'authorization: Bearer your-appmaker-token'
```

# App Keys

This set of endpoints is used to provision and revoke secret keys for a Smooch app. A JWT with scope 'appMaker' is required to access the secret keys API.

# Integrations

This set of endpoints is used to configure and manage various front-end messaging channels. A JWT is required with either 'app' or 'appMaker' scope. The paths below assume that the call will be made using an 'appMaker' scoped JWT, and thus the /apps/:appId portion of the URL is required. If using an 'app' scope JWT, this path is implied, and may be omitted.

Some integrations require some additional setup. [See below](#) for more channel specific details.

The currently supported integration types are: Messenger, Line, Telegram and Twilio (SMS).
